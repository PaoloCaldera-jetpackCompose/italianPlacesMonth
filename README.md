## Italian Places Month

Italian Places Month is the test project of the third unit of the *Android Basics with Compose* learning path, provided by Android Developers. It is focused on building lists and improving the user interface with Jetpack Compose. The application displays a list of 30 cards, one per each day of the month, where beautiful Italian places and historical buildings have been represented.

The project demonstrates the ability to build lists and improve the application quality by setting a theme and animations. Indeed, the entire theme has been built up entirely from scratch, selecting colors, fonts, and shapes for the app. The main topics covered in this project are listed below:

* [List]()

The project comprises just one screen whose layout is developed through Jetpack Compose. The list has been built with the [LazyColumn]() composable and the theme has been selected with the help of {Material Design 3 Theme Generator]().
