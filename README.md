# Italian Places Month

Italian Places Month is the test project of the third unit of the *Android Basics with Compose* learning path, provided by Android Developers. It is focused on building lists and improving the user interface with Jetpack Compose. The application displays a list of 30 cards, one per each day of the month, where beautiful Italian places and historical buildings have been represented.

The project demonstrates the ability to build lists and improve the application quality by setting a theme and animations. Indeed, the entire theme has been built up entirely from scratch, selecting colors, fonts, and shapes for the app. The main topics covered in this project are listed below:

* [LazyColumn](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/lazy/package-summary#LazyColumn(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyListState,androidx.compose.foundation.layout.PaddingValues,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Arrangement.Vertical,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment.Horizontal,androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.FlingBehavior,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function1)) composable for the creation of the scrollable list
* [Adaptive Icons](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive) for the creation of the app icon
* [Color](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview), [Typography](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview) and [Shape](https://m3.material.io/styles/shape/overview) for setting the app theme
* [Jetpack Compose Animation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation) for setting simple animations ([Spring](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/customize#spring) animation has been used)

The project comprises just one screen whose layout is developed through Jetpack Compose. The theme has been selected and created with the help of [Material Design 3 Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom).
